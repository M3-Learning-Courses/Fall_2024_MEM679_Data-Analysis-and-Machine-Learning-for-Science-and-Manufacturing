## Due Date

**Due:** 11:59 PM EST, Sunday, 10-06-2023

## Overview

The objective of this homework is to craft a comprehensive whitepaper delineating the scope and specifics of your final project for this course. The whitepaper should succinctly introduce both the problem domain and the dataset utilized. You are encouraged to choose a dataset and problem that align with your research interests or professional work. For those without a specific dataset, public repositories such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) can be considered. Refer to the course syllabus for further insights into the kinds of assignments you will undertake using this dataset.

## Criteria for Dataset Selection

Select a dataset that is sufficiently complex and versatile for use throughout the course. The dataset should ideally be high-dimensional with a multitude of features, and large enough for both training and validation in machine learning contexts. It should be in a format that is readily importable into Python, such as CSV, JSON, or a database file. Ensure that you have the requisite permissions to use the dataset, and cite it appropriately in your whitepaper if it's from a public repository. Scientific datasets might include but are not limited to, spectroscopic data, microscopy series, or video data collections.

### Key Considerations

- **Sample Size**: Opt for datasets with a substantial number of samples (generally >1000) for effective machine learning model training.
- **Feature Richness**: A dataset with a low feature count (<10) may be unsuitable for machine learning.
- **Accessibility**: Confirm that you have the appropriate permissions to use the dataset.
- **Metadata**: Choose datasets with descriptive metadata to aid in understanding the dataset's contextual nuances.

### Guidance for the Indecisive: Leverage Drexel's Scientific Resources

Should the expansive range of dataset choices prove to be daunting, you may wish to explore the datasets available from Drexel's specialized scientific instrumentation facilities. For further details and inquiries, please reach out to Prof. Agar. This approach not only simplifies your dataset selection but also affords the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to ongoing scientific investigations at Drexel.

## Assignment Tasks

Your responsibilities in this assignment are as follows:

1. **Dataset Identification**: Describe the chosen datasetâ€™s structure, including its format, the information it contains, and any labels provided.
2. **Problem Statement**: Articulate a specific problem or question that the dataset can help address. Clarify the objectives and scope of your project.
3. **State-of-the-Art Review**: Offer a concise statement on the current state-of-the-art methodologies in computation and analysis related to your chosen problem domain.

## Grading Metrics

Grading for this assignment is effort-based. Early engagement in conceptualizing your final project is crucial. Prof. Agar will offer constructive feedback on your submission in a 15-minute virtual meeting. Should the dataset not meet the course requirements and necessitate its replacement, you will be accountable for resubmitting the assignment. This preparation is essential, as it forms part of your final presentation.

## Submission Guidelines

You can submit this first assignment on blackboard learn. In the future, you will submit your assignments via GitHub Classroom. The prefered submission format will be markdown, however, a PDF or Word document will be accepted at this stage. At a later point in the class you will be required to convert your assignment to markdown and add it to your git repository for the course.
