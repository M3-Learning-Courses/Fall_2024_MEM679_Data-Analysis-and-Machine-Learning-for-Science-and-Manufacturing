# Homework 4: Publishing Data with DataFed

## Due Nov. 21, 2024

## Objective

This assignment is designed to provide practical experience with DataFed, a data management system for scientific data. You will set up DataFed, transfer at least one data record associated with your project, and ensure that the data record includes all necessary metadata. This exercise requires following the tutorial outlined in the lecture notes and demonstrates proficiency in handling and managing data in a scientific context. The key is that the data records you need for your work are accessible to myself and other external users. You will also get practice in forming a metadata schema.

## Note on Data Privacy

If your data is associated with your research project, please be aware that DataFed is legally classified for use with only **open data**. While DataFed has policies in place to meet higher security standards, it has not been formally approved for handling sensitive or restricted data. If you have any data privacy concerns, it is advisable to err on the side of caution and avoid using DataFed for your final project. Instead, you may complete this assignment using any open dataset available on the web. If you believe DataFed does not meet the security standards required for your data, please inform me.

## Assignment Details

1. **DataFed Account Setup:**
   - Register for a DataFed account, following the instructions provided in the lecture notes.
   - Familiarize yourself with the DataFed dashboard and its features.

2. **Data Record Preparation:**
   - Select a data record relevant to your ongoing project. This could be a dataset you have generated or one that is integral to your project's research.
   - Ensure that the data is in a suitable format for transfer to DataFed. This should be a single combined file record of any type which can be read in python. 

3. **Metadata Specification:**
   - Prepare detailed metadata for your data record. Metadata should include, but is not limited to, the following components:
     - Title and Description: A clear and concise title and description of the data record.
     - Authorship and Affiliations: Names and affiliations of the individuals who generated the data.
     - Date of Data Creation: The date(s) on which the data was generated.
     - Data Type and Format: Specification of the data type (e.g., numerical, textual, image) and file format.
     - Keywords: Relevant keywords that describe the data record for searchability.
     - Any other project-specific metadata as per the requirements of your research field.

4. **Data Transfer to DataFed:**
   - Follow the tutorial steps to transfer your prepared data record to DataFed.
   - Ensure that the data record is correctly uploaded and that all metadata is accurately entered into the system.

5. **Verification:**
   - Verify that your data record is searchable and accessible within DataFed.
   - Verify that you can programmatically access your data record using the DataFed API.


## Submission Requirements

- This assignment should be included as part of your final project repository on GitHub. This should be the same repository that you used for your visualization assignment.
