# Homework 3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Dash, and Panel

## Due Nov. 1, 2024

## Objective

Create effective and engaging data visualizations using `matplotlib`, `Dash`, and `Panel`. The goal is to produce publication-quality static graphics and an interactive visualization that conveys complex data clearly and effectively.

## Dataset

For this assignment you will use your dataset for your project. It is important that you use this activity to build familiarity with your dataset. You will need to use this dataset for your final project. Make sure you visualize the input data and the labels if you have labels.

## Task Requirements

1. **Visualization Selection (3 Plots):**

   - **Static Visualizations (2 Plots):**
     - Use `matplotlib` to create static plots of your choice, such as line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, etc. The goal of these plots is to visualize examples randomly or of selected categories of your dataset. If you have quantitative data you should use a set of histograms (or violin plots) to show the distribution of the data. If you have image data you should display selected images from your dataset and random examples.
     - Incorporate at least three visual elements (color, shape, size, etc.) to depict different data dimensions or categories.
   - **Interactive Visualization (1 Plot):**
     - Use `Dash` or `Panel` to create one interactive plot.
     - The interactivity should allow users to change the visualization in at least one substantial way.

2. **Code and Documentation:**

   - Supply the source code for generating the plots.
   - Thoroughly comment your code to explain your methods and choices.
   - The plots with the exception of the interactive plot should be written in a Jupyter Notebook which should describe:
     - The dataset selection.
     - The types of plots chosen and their purpose.
     - Instructions for running your code.
     - Guide should be provided for the interactive graphic

3. **Submission:**

   - I want you to own your own repo for your final project. Therefore, you will submit a link to your repo for this assignment. Please email me a link to your repo.
   - The framework should be based on a PyScaffold.

4. **Publication-Quality:**
   - Ensure that visualizations are clean, attractive, and suitable for a publication or presentation context.

## Grading Rubric (Total Points: 100)

| Criteria                              | Points    |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Visual Design**                     | 20 points |
| **Code Quality**                      | 20 points |
| **Complexity and Creativity**         | 20 points |
| **Interactivity (for Dash plot)**     | 20 points |
| **Documentation and Reproducibility** | 10 points |
| **Adherence to Best Practices**       | 10 points |

#### Points Distribution

- **Visual Design (20 points):**

  - Excellent (18-20): Plots are exceptionally clear and well-designed.
  - Good (15-17): Plots are clear with minor improvements needed.
  - Satisfactory (12-14): Plots are acceptable but could be enhanced.
  - Needs Improvement (0-11): Plots lack clarity and design quality.

- **Code Quality (20 points):**

  - Excellent (18-20): Code is well-structured, efficiently uses functions/classes, and is fully documented.
  - Good (15-17): Code is organized and documented with some use of functions/classes.
  - Satisfactory (12-14): Code is somewhat organized and documented but lacks efficiency.
  - Needs Improvement (0-11): Code is disorganized and poorly documented.

- **Complexity and Creativity (20 points):**

  - Excellent (18-20): Techniques show advanced complexity and creativity.
  - Good (15-17): Techniques are appropriate but not complex.
  - Satisfactory (12-14): Techniques are basic and need more insight.
  - Needs Improvement (0-11): Techniques are too simplistic or inappropriate.

- **Interactivity (20 points):**

  - Excellent (18-20): Interactive elements are intuitive and enhance the visualization.
  - Good (15-17): Interactivity adds value with minor issues.
  - Satisfactory (12-14): Interactivity is present but does not add significant value.
  - Needs Improvement (0-11): Interactive elements are poorly implemented.

- **Documentation and Reproducibility (10 points):**

  - Excellent (9-10): Documentation is comprehensive and well-organized.
  - Good (7-8): Documentation is thorough and allows for reproduction.
  - Satisfactory (5-6): Documentation is present but lacks clarity.
  - Needs Improvement (0-4): Documentation is incomplete or unclear.

- **Adherence to Best Practices (10 points):**
  - Excellent (9-10): Shows an exceptional understanding and application of best practices.
  - Good (7-8): Demonstrates a good understanding with minor deviations.
  - Satisfactory (5-6): Shows a basic understanding but inconsistent application.
  - Needs Improvement (0-4): Fails to apply best practices.

### Additional Notes

- Each criterion is critical to the overall effectiveness of the visualization. Points will be deducted for errors or omissions relevant to each criterion.
- While creativity is encouraged, clarity and accuracy of the data should be the main focus.
- The more effort you put in on this assignment the less you will have to do for the final project.
