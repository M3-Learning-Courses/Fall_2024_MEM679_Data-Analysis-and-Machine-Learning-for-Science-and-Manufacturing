  abstract = {Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to
              identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show
              that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide
              approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant
              racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are
              considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of
              uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase
              the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from
              17.7 to 46.5\%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts
              health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care
              means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for
              White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an
              effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive
              accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice
              of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can
              be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.},
