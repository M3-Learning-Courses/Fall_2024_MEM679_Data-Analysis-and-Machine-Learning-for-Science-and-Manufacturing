# Final Project

## Goals

The only way to truly master data-enabled science and engineering is to implement a workflow. This will expose you to problems that you will encounter in the real world. The goal of this project is to develop a software package that can be used to solve a problem in your field of study. This project will follow the timeline of the course. Many of the homework assignments will have you complete specific subtasks with your dataset. The final result will be a complete well-documented package. At the conclusion of the course, you will present your project to the class highlighting the impact on your subfield.

## Assignment Components

### GitHub Repository (40%)

For your assignment, you are required to create and manage your software development using version control on GitHub. Your repository does not have to be public but will need to be shared for grading.

| **Topic**                                                                      | **Percentage** | **Points Scored** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |
| Code Functionality - _How much functionality is included in the code?_         | 40             |                   |
| In-code Documentation - _How readable is your code?_                           | 15             |                   |
| Code Reusability - _How easy is it for someone to reuse and extend your code?_ | 25             |                   |
| Usage Documentation - _How easy is it for someone new to your code to use it?_ | 20             |                   |

#### Hints

- Make sure to comment on most lines of code
- Functions can be documented using a standard format for autodoc string
- Try to follow python conventions PEP8 or Black
- Make tutorial notebooks that users can explore
- Create `readthedocs`
- Add environment configuration file
- Serve your package in a Docker container
- Add a license file for reuse
- Add continuous integration

### Presentation (40%)

You will be required to prepare a 12-minute presentation describing your final project. The project will be graded using a combination of peer reviews and Prof. Agar's evaluation. At Prof. Agar's discretion, he can exclude any peer evaluation, which he feels is unfair.

#### Topics to Cover

1. The problem that your project addresses
1. Computational tools which are developed
1. Demonstration of how your tool works
1. Future development roadmap and impact
